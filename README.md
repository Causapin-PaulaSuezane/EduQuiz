## II. OOP Principles 🧑‍💻

### 1. **Encapsulation** 🔒
  - Used in the `User class`, `Student class`, and `Teacher class` with `priavte attributes` and `public getters and setter`.
    
  - Each quiz class (e.g.,` MathQuiz`, `ScienceQuiz`, `HistoryQuiz`) encapsulates its questions, answers, and correct answer validations.
    
  - Class `QuestionMulti` also uses `encapsulation` as it all data and behaviors related to a multiple-choice question. By using `private fields` and `public methods`, it ensures that `questions`, `options`, and `answers` are managed securely and accessed only through controlled mechanisms.
    
#### **Private Attributes**
  - User details like `fullname`, `username`, `password`, `role` and `quiz data` are declared as **private** in their respective classes, preventing unauthorized access or modification.
  - `Question Multi` class' private attributes are `question`, `optionA`, `optionB`, `optionC`, `optionD`, `correctAnswer`, `createdBy`, and `subject`.
    
#### **Public Getters and Setter**
  - **Methods like :**
  - `getUsername()` - to retrieve user's `username`
  - `getPassword()` - to retrieve user's `password`
  - `getFullname()` - to retrieve user's `full name`
  - `getRole()` - to retrive the `role` chosen by the user
  - `getSubjects()` - to retrieve user's chosen `subject`
  - `getScores()` - to retrieve the student's `score`
  - `setScore(int subjectIndex, int score)` - to set tbe student's `score`
  - `getQuestion()` - to retrieve the stored `quiz questions`
  - `getOptionA()`, `getOptionB()`, `getOptionC()`, `getOptionD()` - retrives the `options` in the multiple choice quiz
  - `getCorrectAnswer()` - retrieves the `correct answer` in a quiz
  - `getCreatedBy()` - retrieves the `creator` of the quiz question


### 2. **Inheritance** 🌳  
  - Used mainly in the `User class`, `Student class`, and `Teacher class` where `User` is the parent class and `Student` and `Teacher` are the child classes.
#### **Child Classes (Student, Teacher) :** 
  - `Student` : attributes like `username`, `password`, `fullname`, and `subjects` from the parent class `User` and an attribute like `score` that is unique only to the student chile class.
  - `Teacher` : same as the student's classes from the parent class `User`.
    
### 3. **Polymorphism** 🔄

### 4. **Abstraction** 🖼

## III. Details of the Chosen SDG and Its Integration 🌍
 
The **EduQuiz** project supports **SDG 4: Quality Education** by providing an interactive venue for students to learn and take quizzes on a wide range of subjects. It continuously motivates learners to pursue self-assessment, which is a pillar in the development of education.

Here's how it integrates SDG 4📄✏️

- **Inclusive Education:** The application makes it accessible to all the students irrespective of their location so that they can take quizzes at any time and anywhere. This achieves quality education for everybody. 🌏
- Personalized Learning: Students can take quizzes on subjects they are registered for, enabling them to focus on areas they need to improve, thus supporting personalized learning paths. 📈
